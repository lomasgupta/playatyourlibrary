# Play At Your Library
--------------------

This directory contains the custom files for this Play at your Library. 
The structure will follow a lullabot boilerplate approach so the codebase
is in docroot. All site-specific fonts, libraries, modules, and themes 
should be placed in their respective directories.

Forked branch; will have merge pull with master
